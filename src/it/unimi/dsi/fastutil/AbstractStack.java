/** An abstract class providing basic methods for implementing the {@link Stack} interface.

 *
 * Subclasses of this class may choose to implement just {@link Stack#push(Object)},
 * {@link Stack#pop()} and {@link Stack#isEmpty()}, or (but this is not
 * required) go farther and implement {@link Stack#top()}, or even {@link
 * Stack#peek(int)}.
